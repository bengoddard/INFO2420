<p>My first impression of this site is that this website is set up in a great way for you to be able to see a lot of info right off the bat.
They organize the flow of info by having links in the navbar at the top of the page, and some other links on the right side of the page. The site structure makes sense to me because everything is clearly labeled and organized.</p>
<p>I think the site's graphics and multimedia enhance the site because it helps you see or visualize what each article is about.
The home page loaded very fast. The text color is and size are great and make it very easy to read. The site does have a navbar and it has basically every link you need in it.</p>
<p>For most of the pages, there is a very similar layout and color scheme. It does a great job changing layout of everything when the window size changes.
I think the home page does a really good job of showing the articles and multimedia in an interesting way that keeps you engaged.</p>
